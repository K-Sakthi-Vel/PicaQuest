Welcome to my application PicaQuest.

I am Sakthivel.

Description:
PicaQuest allows users to navigate variety of pictures, see them like then also users can download the image if they like it.

LIVE APP: https://picaquest.vercel.app/

Tech stacks:
React, JSX, fetch, React Hooks and CSS modules.

Data flow and operation: 
As we have the url of 3 pages which has the data of pictures, we fetch them using fetch keyword it is basically happens asynchronously, since it is async call we should perform it inside the useEffect, as soon as we fetch the data from the api we store it in the state, then we map through the array of objects and render them.
